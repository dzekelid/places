name: Foursquare
description: Foursquare is a geographical location based social network that incorporates
  gaming elements.nbsp; Users share their location with friends by ldquo;checking
  inrdquo; via a smartphone app or by text message. Points are awarded for checking
  in at various venues. Users can connect their Foursquare accounts to their Twitter
  and Facebook accounts, which can update when a check in is registered. By checking
  in a certain number of times, or in different locations, users can collect virtual
  badges. In addition, users who have checked in the most times at a certain venue
  will be crowned ldquo;Mayorrdquo; until someone surpasses their number. Various
  venues have embraced Foursquare, and offer special deals to users who are ldquo;mayorsrdquo;.
